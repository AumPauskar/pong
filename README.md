# pong
Ping pong game with save state


INSTRUCTIONS!!!:
1. Download all the files and make sure to save them in one folder/directory
   (You may ignore pong 2.0 as pong 3 is built upon pong 2.0)
2. Pong 3 is the core file so open it with python or any IDE that has python working enviorment
3. Minimum disk space requitred=40KB (so no half filled low density floppys) but the save function will definately increase the disk space
4. Image used in the gameover screen belongs to Nintendo EAD and we don't hold any responsiblity.
